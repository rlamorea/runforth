# RunForth

A (not so) simple online Forth runner.

## Introduction

RunForth provides a way to edit Forth code and execute it directly in the browser.

It provides a simple means of debugging by viewing stack contents on each executed line.

It also provides a means to accept keyboard input, though this requires some non-standard extensions.

You can (test it out here)[https://rlamorea.github.io/runforth/].
